# ConwaysGameOfLife
In an attempt to learn more about coding in Unity, I will be following a tutorial on how to create Conway's game of life in Unity. Source can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHqfkMu1Syw&amp;list=PLiRrp7UEG13YiTwVr1wPnYtTvt12ZKg1r&amp;index=1

Update: While the playlist is 14 videos long, I only watched the first 3. The last commit that was made with the help of this playlist was the 10th commit. 
All commits after the 10th were done on my own. I will attempt to modify and make changes to make a version that is more unique.
